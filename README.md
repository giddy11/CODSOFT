# CodSoft Internship (`Python`)
I got the opportunity to intern as a `Python` developer and with **CodSoft** and here
(in this repository) are the projects that I had to build withing 4 weeks to get certified.


There were 5 projects in all and I was supposed to get at least 3 of them done within the 4 weeks of internship


**N/B: PLEASE THE CODE I IMPLEMENTED DOESNT HANDLE EXCEPTIONS. TRY TO ENTER VALID INPUTS FOR NOW. HOPING TO EXTEND THE FUNCTIONALITIES AS I PROGRESS IN MY PYTHON PRACTICE**
**WHEN I LEARN HOW TO HANDLE EXCEPTIONS AND ALSO OPTIMISE MY CODE**


***The projects were as follows:***


## Task 1: **ToDo - List**
A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a command-line or
GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists


## Task 2: [Calculator](https://github.com/giddy11/CODSOFT/tree/master/Task_2)
Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. Perform the calculation and display
the result.


## Task 3: [Password Generator](https://github.com/giddy11/CODSOFT/tree/master/Task_3)
A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using
Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.


**User Input:** Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.


**Generate Password:** Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.


**Display the Password:** Print the generated password on the screen.


## Task 4: [Rock-Paper-Scissors Game](https://github.com/giddy11/CODSOFT/tree/master/Task_4)
**User Input:** Prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.


**Computer Selection:** Generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.


**Game Logic:** Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.
> *Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock*


**Display Result:** Show the user's choice and the computer's choice.
> *Display the result, whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie*


**Score Tracking (Optional):** Keep track of the user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds.


**Play Again:** Ask the user if they want to play another round.


**User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.


## Task 5: [Contact Book](https://github.com/giddy11/CODSOFT/tree/master/Task_5)
**Contact Information:** Store name, phone number, email, and address for each contact.


**Add Contact:** Allow users to add new contacts with their details.


**View Contact List:** Display a list of all saved contacts with names and phone numbers.


**Search Contact:** Implement a search function to find contacts by name or phone number.


**Update Contact:** Enable users to update contact details.


**Delete Contact:** Provide an option to delete a contact.


**User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
